"With reference to the reuse of materials, the projects created in implementation of the Group’s investment plans for the Italian motorway network provided for the reuse - within the regulatory limits - of the earth deriving from excavations, in order to mitigate the environmental impact linked mainly to the procurement of inert quarry materials and the disposal in landfills of unused materials. They are reused to create embankments, landscaping and noise-absorbing dunes, as well as for the redevelopment of degraded areas (such as abandoned quarries)."
"2019 also saw the continuation of activities regarding lighting, with widespread use of LED technology, both in motorway tunnels and airports, as well as in buildings, which reduced electrical energy consumption by around 5.4 GWh. As regards air conditioning, modernisation of the systems continued, with more efficient machinery, such as refrigeration units, significant results have been obtained with monitoring and diagnostic platforms that have reduced waste, for a total saving of 3.7 Gwh of electricity."
"The aim of this model is to screen out the worst of the emitters that will be most affected by policy changes, and which are incompatible with the aims of the Paris Agreement."

"Outcome: The bank explained that it would be winding down its fossil fuel-related merger and acquisition advice, investing substantially in clean tech and banking services, and that it was preparing its first TCFD report."
"Climate change is producing changes in weather and other environmental conditions, including temperature and precipitation levels, and thus may affect consumer demand for electricity. In addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, could disrupt NRG's operations and supply chain, and cause them to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these effects. These or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or power purchase costs. NRG's commercial and residential customers may also experience the potential physical impacts of climate change and may incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these efforts, including increasing the mix and resiliency of their energy solutions and supply."
