"Managing weather impacts Tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons) present a risk to our coastal and inland infrastructure, includ- ing our network and facilities. These events may increase our capital and operating costs to maintain and/or repair our facilities following the event. Every year we make significant investments in real estate and net- work maintenance and upgrades to build resilience into our operational infrastructure. Based on the lessons learned during storms such as Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Matthew, and Hurricane Michael, we have taken steps to increase the resilience of our network in affected areas and other at-risk areas. Depending on the area and risk, these steps to enhance infrastructure resilience have included adding stilts to raise equipment that powers cell sites, moving site generators from basements to a higher level or platforms, and installing new fiber solutions underground rather than using aerial fiber. We also have ongoing efforts to improve backup facility power systems, including power capacity at facilities located in areas with greater storm and wildfire risk, by adding generators to at-risk sites where, historically, the site only had backup batteries. Federal, state, and local regulators may create requirements that change the type and timing of actions we take, which could result in higher operating costs than anticipated.",0

"THE ISSUE Investors, in our view, have been too slow to recognize and address the substantial systemic threat that deforestation poses to the climate, local communities, biodiversity and human rights. Many consumer goods companies purchase commodities, like palm oil and soy, through supply chains that originate in rainforests in places like Indonesia and Guatemala. Deforestation is a principal driver of climate change, responsible for roughly 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Extensive—and oftentimes illegal—deforestation can have devastating impacts on biodiversity and on local and indigenous communities that depend on forests for their livelihoods. Deforestation has also been linked to severe human rights violations and, in recent years, environmental campaigners and protesters have been arrested and killed in record numbers.",0
