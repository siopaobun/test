"For example, the E-FACE fund, which was created in 2016 and receives €2 million each year, will finance the cost differential between a traditional solution and an alternative, low-carbon solution for all the Group’s eligible commercial projects from 2017. This fund constitutes an important source of financing for Group efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of its projects. Other benefits include the detailed identification of low carbon materials, products and processes that can easily replace carbon solutions, and the monitoring of carbon levels in purchases for accounting purposes.",2
"AXA decided two years ago to divest €500 million from the coal industry by targeting companies which derive over 50% of their revenues from coal. The Group has decided to increase its divestment fivefold to reach €2.4 billion, by divesting from companies which derive more than 30% of their revenues from coal, have a coal-based energy mix that exceeds 30%, actively build new coal plants, or produce more than 20 million tonnes of coal per year.",1
"There are many projections about the future growth and decline rates of fossil fuels usage. However, whether we like it or not, the reality is that the world currently remains deeply reliant upon fossil fuels for reliable energy. We treat these long-term projections with caution though, as supply, demand and pricing are driven by many inter-related variables which become increasingly difficult to predict the longer the time horizon. Additionally, technological disruption can occur quickly.",0
"Most of our CO2 emissions are generated during the use phase of the vehicles.

Training The board is receiving ongoing training to ensure their skills and knowledge are enhanced with respect to climate change. In 2020 a total of 559 employees were trained on ‘What the Covid-19 pandemic can teach us about climate change’ and ‘How climate risk affects Nedbank?' through the Nedbank Risk Business School. Various informal training sessions were also conducted. Fit-for purpose training will continue across the enterprise to ensure climate change is integrated into the various functions. This includes e-learnings for all Nedbank employees.,1
"With reference to the reuse of materials, the projects created in implementation of the Group’s investment plans for the Italian motorway network provided for the reuse - within the regulatory limits - of the earth deriving from excavations, in order to mitigate the environmental impact linked mainly to the procurement of inert quarry materials and the disposal in landfills of unused materials. They are reused to create embankments, landscaping and noise-absorbing dunes, as well as for the redevelopment of degraded areas (such as abandoned quarries).",2

"In addition, several of our key products are manufactured at a particular manufacturing facility, with limited alternate facilities. If an event occurs that results in damage to one or more of such facilities, such as the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico in September 2017, we may be unable to manufacture the relevant products at the previous levels or at all. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility, a third-party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing capacity is lost.",0
"To mitigate business partner risks, adidas has implemented various measures. For example, we generally include clauses in contractual agreements with partners that allow us to suspend or even terminate our partnership in case of improper or unethical conduct. In addition, we work with a broad portfolio of promotion partners to reduce the dependency on the success and popularity of a few individual partners. We utilize a broad distribution strategy which includes further expansion of our direct-to-consumer business to reduce the risk of overreliance on key customers. Specifically, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of the company’s sales in 2020. To reduce risk in the supply chain, we work with suppliers who demonstrate reliability, quality and innovation. Furthermore, in order to minimize any potential negative consequences such as a violation of our Workplace Standards by our suppliers, we enforce strict control and inspection procedures at our suppliers and also demand adherence to social and environmental standards throughout our supply chain. In addition, we have selectively bought insurance coverage for the risk of business interruptions caused by physical damage to suppliers’ premises. To reduce supplier dependency, the company follows a strategy of diversification. In this context, adidas works with a broad network of suppliers in different countries and, for the vast majority of its products, does not have a single-sourcing model.",0
"Development of the Alberta oil sands has received considerable attention in recent public commentary on the subjects of environmental impact, climate change and GHG emissions. Despite that much of the focus is on bitumen mining operations and not in-situ production, public concerns about oil sands generally and GHG emissions and water and land use practices in oil sands developments specifically may, directly or indirectly, impair the profitability of our current oil sands projects, and the viability of future oil sands projects, by creating significant regulatory uncertainty leading to uncertainty in economic modeling of current and future projects and delays relating to the sanctioning of future projects.",0
"During the first week of May 2016, extreme wildfires in northeastern Alberta resulted in the shutdown of a number of oil sands production facilities and the evacuation of more than 80,000 people from the city of Fort McMurray, which serves as a commercial and regional logistics centre for the oil sands region and a home to a significant portion of the oil sands workforce.",0
"Concerns regarding global climate change may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate even more restrictive standards than the voluntary commitments that we have made or require such changes on a more accelerated timeframe. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. In addition, there are discussions regarding potential defunding of climate-related international agreements and/or initiatives that could affect our competitiveness in certain markets. Such regulatory uncertainty extends to future incentives for energy efficient buildings and vehicles and costs of compliance, which may impact the demand for our products, obsolescence of our products and our results of operations.",0
